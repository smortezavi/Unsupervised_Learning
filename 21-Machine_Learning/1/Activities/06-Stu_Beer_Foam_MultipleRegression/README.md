# Beer Foam

* In this activity, you will calculate a multiple regression line to predict the time from pour using the measurements of foam height and beer height.

## Instructions

* Use sklearn's linear regression model to perform multiple linear regression using the features foam height and beer height for `X` and time for `y`.

* Compute the R2 score for the training and testing data separately.

* Plot the Residuals for the Training and Testing data.
