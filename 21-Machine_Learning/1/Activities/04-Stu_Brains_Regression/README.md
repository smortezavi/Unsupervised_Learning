# Brains!

* In this activity, you will calculate a regression line to predict head size vs. brain weight.

## Instructions

* Start by creating a scatter plot of the data to visually see if any linear trend exists.

* Split the data into training and testing using sklearn's `train_test_split` function.

* Next, use sklearn's linear regression model and fit the model to the training data.

* Use the test data to make new predictions. Calculate the MSE and R2 score for those predictions.

* Use `model.score` to calculate the R2 score for the test data.
